        <h4><a href="https://github.com/ThomasCreagh/thomascreagh.github.io/tree/main/sec-writeups">My Security
            Writeups</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>I have documented a few of the caputre the flags I do on sites such as <a
                href="https://picoctf.com">picoctf</a>.</p>
          </li>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/ThomasCreagh/zallet">Zallet</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Zallet is my first blockchain project with a wallet. I wrote it in zig and used Ed25519 Signing to
              encrypt transactions between wallets. I used Sha256 to hash the blocks on the chain. I used the proof by
              work method to verify blocks on the blockchain.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/FionaWright/High5ive">3D Flight Map</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>3D Flight Map is a flight statistics viewer with graphs, queries and a 3D globe that displays the
              airports and flights all around the world. I worked on fast data retrieval of data and optimizing ram
              usage by reducing and compressing data. I also made a querying system that was modular and used
              concurrency to speed up the queries and increase retrieval time.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a
            href="https://github.com/ThomasCreagh/AI-Agents-for-Code-Review-and-Security-using-Open-Source-Models">Software
            Engineering Project 2025 IBM</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>I worked along with a team from trinity to create AI Agents for Code Review and Security using Open
              Source Models for our IBM clients, Mihai Criveti and Panpan Lin as a part of my software engineering
              module. I made the backend with Fast Api and containerised it with Docker. I created the gitlab pipeline
              and deployed it in a production ready state to a custom domain on a hetzner vps with https.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/ThomasCreagh/website/">This website!</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>This website is made in pure good old HTML and CSS. I had a lot of fun creating this site. I origanally hosted it on tor with a tor hidden service which was interesting seeing all the quirks that goes into making a tor site.</p>
